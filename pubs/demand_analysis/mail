Status: RO

Dear colleague, 

We thought you might have an interest in the PEPM Workshop, so here is
the CFP. 

Please let us know if you prefer *not* to receive email reminders such
as this; then we will remove you from our (private) PEPM mailing list.

		     CALL FOR PAPERS --- PEPM'94

		       ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
     Partial Evaluation and Semantics-Based Program Manipulation

			    June 25, 1994
			   Orlando, Florida
	       (Held in conjunction with PLDI and LFP)


The theme of the workshop is partial evaluation and other techniques
for automatic analysis and transformation of programs.  Such
techniques promise to assist in developing efficient and reliable
programs.  Examples are: automatic specialization of general programs,
and transformation of obviously correct but inefficient programs into
more efficient programs.

Typical relevant topics are: program transformation, program
specialization, partial evaluation, mixed computation,
supercompilation, abstract interpretation, static analysis,
binding-time analysis, generalization, staging, memoization, compiler
generation.

Original results that bear upon these topics are solicited.  In
particular, we encourage reports of the following three kinds:

* Experience with applications (for instance, scientific
  computing, parsing and pattern matching, semantics-directed compiler
  generation, programming environments, debugging, incremental
  computation, meta-programming, and prototyping).

* Comparison of the program manipulation techniques used for
  different types of programming languages (such as functional,
  logical, imperative, object oriented, and concurrent languages).

* Comparison of these techniques with more traditional programming
  and computer science concepts.

Send your submission by electronic mail to *both* program chairs in
the form of a Postscript file or a self-contained TeX or LaTeX file.
If this is impossible, send 4 printed copies to Peter Sestoft,
Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Denmark,
Building 344, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.

Submissions must be received on or before February 7, 1994, must
include return mail and email addresses, and should be at most 10
pages long.  Papers will be judged on relevance, significance,
correctness and clarity, and must include an abstract and discussion
of related work.

Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings.  These will be
distributed at the workshop and will subsequently be available as a
technical report from the University of Melbourne, Australia.

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the ACM SIGPLAN '94
Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI
'94) and the 1994 ACM Conference on Lisp and Functional Programming
(LFP '94).

Important dates:
Submission deadline 		February 7, 1994

Dear Author(s):

We are pleased to inform you that your paper 

24: PERs from Projections for Binding-Time Analysis

has been accepted for PEPM 94.  We were able to accept 13 of the 45
submitted papers.  The final program will soon be ftp'able from
ftp.id.dth.dk (Internet 130.225.76.51) in file
pub/sestoft/pepm94-pgm.asc

Included please find the referees' comments about your paper (in dvi
format).  Please revise your paper in accordance with the referees' 
suggestions and send a final version to
	
	Harald Sondergaard
	Department of Computer Science 
	The University of Melbourne		harald@cs.mu.oz.au
	Parkville 3052 Vic.			ph.: +613 287 9164
	Australia 				fax: +613 348 1184

to arrive no later than 23 May.  Papers should be no more than 12
pages long, including references, should be typeset in two-column
format, using a font size of at least 9pt.  Please omit page numbers.
We expect to have the proceedings printed in Orlando, on American 
sized (8.5" by 11") paper.  We suggest that latex users use the style
file `acmconf.sty', which can be ftp'ed from ftp.id.dth.dk (Internet
130.225.76.51) file pub/sestoft/acmconf.sty.

Papers submitted by electronic mail should be either in Postscript 
or self-contained tex/latex, and preferably uuencoded to avoid
problems with mail handlers.  Papers can also be sent in printed 
paper form, by air mail.

The following is from the organizers of the Sigplan June Conferences:
If you are going to attend PLDI'94, LFP'94 and/or one of their three
associated workshops (PEPM, ML, Real-time), it is imperative that you
make your hotel reservations at the meeting hotel, the Hilton at Walt
Disney World Village, as soon as possible.  The hotel has informed us
that World Cup Soccer is coming to Orlando during the same weeks as
our meetings; this will cause the hotel to release our block of rooms
to World Cup attendees (at much higher prices, we expect), as soon as
our reservation deadline of May 27, 1994 is passed.
Please make your hotel reservations as soon as possible to be assured
of the publicized conference rates. The reservation number is
1-800-782-4414, or you can fax the registration form (obtainable at
our ftp site on speedy.cs.pitt.edu) to 1-407-827-3890.

You will receive a copy of this letter by ordinary mail.  We're 
looking forward to seeing you at the workshop and the adjoining 
conferences.

Yours sincerely,

Peter Sestoft and Harald Sondergaard

Phil,

Following are justification paragraphs for PEPM + LFP, and PEPM + PLDI
+ tutorial.  I'm inclined to think that the latter might be, overall,
more appropriate, but it is the more expensive; can we briefly discuss
this?

Following that are the expense estimates for both.


Justification
-------------

(PEPM '94 and LFP '94)

Kei Davis' paper "PERs from Projections for Binding-time Analysis" has
been accepted to the ACM SIGPLAN '94 Workshop on Partial Evaluation and
Program Manipulation (PEPM '94), to be held June 25, 1994, in Orlando
Florida, USA.  Davis is soon to finish his Ph.D. at the University of
Glasgow; it is appropriate that he not only publish his research, but
present it as well (as is expected in this case).  PEPM '94 is being
held in conjunction with several other closely related ACM SIGPLAN
conferences, workshops, and tutorials; it would also be appropriate for
Davis to attend the following Lisp and Functional Programming
conference, running June 27-29, since they will cover topics relevant
to Davis' work, and in particular, putting the results of Davis' work
into practice.  Finally, it is worth pointing out that this will
genuinely foster and strengthen European/USA ties and
collaboration--much of the work in the represented areas is European,
and it is fitting that such work be presented in person at a conference
in the USA, and that Davis have the opportunity to meet other
researchers in the field.

can be obtained by ftp from speedy.cs.pitt.edu:pub/pldi94/

>From comp.lang.sigplan on March 24:

    ATTENTION all SIGPLAN June'94 Conference Attendees:

    If you are going to attend PLDI'94, LFP'94 and/or one of their three
    associated workshops (PEPM, ML, Real-time), it is imperative that you
    make your hotel reservations at the meeting hotel, the Hilton at Walt
    Disney World Village, as soon as possible.  The hotel has informed us
    that World Cup Soccer is coming to Orlando during the same weeks as
    our meetings; this will cause the hotel to release our block of rooms
    to World Cup attendees (at much higher prices, we expect), as soon as
    our reservation deadline of May 27,1994 is passed.

    Please make your hotel reservations as soon as possible to be assured 
    of the publicized conference rates. The reservation number is
    1-800-782-4414, or you can fax the registration form (obtainable at 
    our ftp site on speedy.cs.pitt.edu) to 1-407-827-3890.

		Tutorial Program

Chaired by Edith Schonberg, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center

There will be a two-day tutorial track held on Monday, June 20, and
Tuesday, June 21.  Each day will consist of two three-hour or four-hour
tutorials. The first day is devoted to programming language paradigms,
including functional and object-oriented language paradigms.  The topic
for the second day is compiler construction, which will span basic as well
as advanced compilation techniques.  Additionally, there will be a
one-hour presentation on Monday, giving a historical perspective of the
field.

To increase the representation of women and minorities in computer
science, a grant was awarded by NSF to provide a limited number of travel
grants to faculty from undergraduate minority and women's colleges and
universities.  Registration fee scholarships will be provided by SIGPLAN
for the faculty awarded these travel grants.  More information on
application procedures can be found in the file nsf.grant via the
anonymous ftp.

Participants will receive copies of the speakers' viewgraphs for the
tutorials they attend.  A limited number of viewgraph copies will be
available for sale to those not registered.


Monday, June 20

9:00am - 12:00pm		Tutorial 1
___________________________________________

Functional Programming Languages, Benjamin Goldberg, New York University

This tutorial will motivate and describe many aspects of functional
programming languages, including program structure, execution order, and
type systems. Functional languages, such as ML, Haskell, Miranda, and
"pure" LISP, are characterized by language support for functions as first
class objects, the absence of side-effects, a high-level notation, and a
clean semantics. In addition, most modern functional languages (such as
ML, Haskell, and Miranda) have flexible static type systems which support
polymorphism and type inference. The issue of strict vs. non-strict
evaluation order will be discussed as well.

1:30 - 4:30pm			Tutorial 2
____________________________________________

Object Oriented Language Paradigm and C++, Stan Lippman, AT&T Bell Laboratories

This tutorial is broken into three segments.  In the first segment, we
look at the evolution of the Object Oriented paradigm.  Using the problem
of a library check-out system, we walk through the procedural, abstract
data type, and object oriented paradigm solution, seeing how each next
step solves existing problems while introducing others.  In the second
segment, we examine the support C++ provides for the primary
characteristics of the Object Oriented paradigm: inheritance through
subtyping and dynamic resolution of functions.  This segment looks at
actual code examples.  In the final segment, we briefly review the C++
object model in terms of how these mechanisms are generally implemented
and the resulting performance characteristics.

5:00 - 6:00pm

A Perspective on Languages and Compilers, Francis Allen, IBM T.J. Research
Center

Tuesday, June 21

8:30am - 12:30pm		Tutorial 3
_____________________________________________

Compiler Construction, Ron Cytron, Washington University

In this tutorial we examine issues and methods pertaining to the
construction of industrial, research, and pedagogical compilers.  Charged
with the task of automatically translating computer languages into some
target representation (typically an executable or interpretable form), a
compiler generally consists of syntax analysis, semantic analysis,
optimization, and code generation.  Topics include: compiler organization,
bootstrapping, and porting; parsing methods, their power and limitations;
practical compiler-compilers (esp. YACC), conflict resolution; error
recovery and repair; symbol tables; abstract syntax trees; type-checking;
post-syntactic analysis; data flow frameworks; template-driven code
generation; and run-time libraries.  While the tutorial must necessarily
sacrifice depth for breadth, the lecture and course notes will cite
resources available for further study.  A particular emphasis of the
tutorial will be the exposition and coordination of the aforementioned
topics into a one-semester college-level course in which students can
successfully create a working compiler.


2:00 - 5:00pm			Tutorial 4
_____________________________________________

Compiling for Parallelism, Guy L. Steele Jr., Thinking Machines Corporation

There are three main schools of programming language and compiler
design for parallel computers:

(1) Write more clever compilers that can make existing sequential
programs run on parallel computers.  (So-called "vectorizing"
compilers are one example.)

(2) Redesign programming languages to have features that are easy to
compile for parallel computers.  (High Performance Fortran is a
recent example.)

(3) Leave the languages and the compilers alone, and instead provide
subroutine libraries for explicit communication.  (Linda and
message-passing libraries fall into this category.)

We will look at some historical examples from each of these areas
of effort and discuss the advantages and difficulties of each.  We
will also look at research in compiler algorithms for automatically
rearranging code or redistributing data among multiple processors so
as to improve the speed and efficiency of parallel computation.  Our
emphasis will be on high-level concepts rather than on the specific
details of any particular algorithm.

	Student Research Forum
	Wednesday, June 22, 1994, 7:30-9:30pm

The Student Research Forum on Wednesday, June 22, 1994, provides an
opportunity for graduate students attending PLDI'94 to discuss their
research at poster sessions.  This two hour evening event will feature
concurrent short presentations by student participants organized in poster
formats.  Each student will be allowed a 3' by 4' space on an easel for
the presentation.  PLDI'94 attendees, including non-students, will be able
to wander among the posters and talk to the students about their research.
Refreshments will be provided.

Students who wish to present a poster display of their research must send
the following information to Professors Barbara Ryder
(ryder@cs.rutgers.edu) and Mary Lou Soffa (soffa@cs.pitt.edu) by April 15,
1994:

	1. a title and 500 word abstract of their proposed presentation
	2. their email address, phone number and surface mail address
	3. name of their department and school

Each prospective participant also is asked to have a short email note of
support of their participation from their faculty research advisor sent to
Professors Ryder and Soffa.  Selected participants will be notified by May
15, 1994.

If there is more interest in this program than can be accommodated easily,
each school will be asked to select its student presenter(s) on the basis
of the size of their annual Ph.D. class, with limited representation from
each Computer Science department.

ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Language, Compiler and Tool Support
	    for Real-Time Systems
		June 21, 1994


On Tuesday June 21, immediately preceding PLDI, there will be the Workshop
on Language, Compiler and Tool Support for Real-Time Systems (LCTS-RTS).
The workshop explores the interface between two dynamic areas of computer
science and engineering: programming languages and real-time systems.

Directions in both fundamental and applied research in real-time computing
have been changing over the last several years, in response to the need
for large, flexible, powerful, and robust systems.  Previous approaches do
not scale, or are at inappropriate levels, for these new applications.
Large complex systems will require both high-level design and
verification, combined with guarantees on the quality of the automatic or
semi-automatic translation into low-level code.

Programming language techniques and approaches are a necessary part of the
solution; on the other hand, complications, often subtle, arise from the
temporal constraints in real-time and reactive systems.  Significant areas
of interaction include: language design, language and compiler-based
techniques for proof of correctness, timing/schedulability analysis, safe
use of hierarchical memory and garbage collection, time-safe optimization,
and tools for debugging and monitoring of real-time and reactive programs.

Approximately ten papers, selected by the program committee, will be
presented at the workshop.

ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML and its Applications
		June 25-26, 1994

Starting on Saturday June 25 and continuing for 1 1/2 days, there will be
the Workshop on ML and its Applications.  This is the fifth in a series of
workshops on ML, and the second sponsored by SIGPLAN.  The workshop is
focused on topics related to the ML family of languages.  Topics include:
applications, programming methodology, and system-building experience, as
well as issues of language design, semantics, implementation, programming
tools and environments for ML.  The program will be announced
electronically in mid April on the comp.lang.sigplan, comp.lang.ml and
comp.lang.functional news groups.  For additional information, contact the
workshop chairman.

ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and
Semantics-based Program Manipulation
		June 25, 1994

On Saturday June 25, following PLDI and preceding L&FP, there will be the
Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Semantics-Based Program Manipulation
(PEPM).  Automatic program manipulation can be seen as a generalization of
the work performed by traditional compilers and application program
generators.

One instance is partial evaluation, which automatically transforms a
general program into a faster specialized program, given just part of its
input.  This has been achieved for a range of languages, including C,
Fortran, Lisp, Prolog, Scheme, and Standard ML.

The workshop will consider techniques as well as applications.  The
techniques are often related to those used in advanced compilers (such as
interprocedural data flow analysis, constant propagation, loop unrolling,
conversion to continuation passing style).  Applications reported so far
include compiler generation, pattern matching, ray tracing, neural network
training, and generation of specialized language processors.

Approximately ten papers, selected by the program committee, will be
presented at the workshop.  The final program for PEPM'94 can be obtained
by anonymous ftp from ftp.id.dth.dk as file pub/sestoft/pepm94-pgm after
April 19.

		General Information

	             Weather

Summer weather generally arrives in Orlando in late May and lasts through
the end of September. Monthly weather statistics indicate that the average
high temperature (for the month of June) is 91 F ( 33 C), an average low
of 71 F (22 C), with an average rainfall of 7.4" (18cm).  Weather is
considerably humid and is interrupted by frequent afternoon thunderstorms,
which usually end by early evening. Suggested summer time dress is casual,
lightweight, comfortable clothing. Sneakers or other comfortable walking
shoes are a must (especially when visiting the theme parks).

Because the sunshine in Orlando is so bright, visitors sometimes
unintentionally over-expose themselves to the sun.  A good sunscreen and a
hat or visor, insure enjoyment of the area's very pleasant weather --- and
a good tan.

	Local Attractions

Orlando's magic began when nature blessed the area with abundant beauty,
abundant sunshine and year-round warm weather. The opening of Walt
Disney's Magic Kingdom in 1971 paved the way for the transformation of
this quiet, agricultural community into one of the world's most popular
vacation destinations. Today, Central Florida is home not only to Magic
Kingdom, Disney-MGM studios and Epcot Center, but also to Cypress Gardens,
Busch Gardens, Sea World, Spaceport USA, Universal Studios Florida, Wet 'n
Wild and 50 other themed attractions.

Guys,

The only reasonably-priced flight I could get lands me in Orlando
on June 23.  I've already made arrangements for June 24-29; does 
anyone have a spare place on June 23?  Space on floor?  (I'm sure
the hotel would permit this for a price considerably less than
the cost of a single room.)

Please let me know.

For what it's worth, the following was accurate a week ago--any
updates appreciated.

Dear Clem, Kei, Lars, Mark, Olivier, and Simon,

As already indicated, we have an agreement with the editors (Carolyn
Talcott and Bob Kessler) of the journal Lisp and Symbolic Computation
(LASC) to publish a special issue based on papers from PEPM'94.
Harald and I will be guest editors, and will organize the refereeing
and do the selection.

LASC has offered favourable conditions, which means that if we can
revise the papers and produce the final papers in Latex form quickly,
then we can have the special issue published with a minimal delay
(even skipping other special issues which are in the pipeline).

We hope to include six papers (listed below), but this allows only 16
PAGES PER PAPER.  The LASC format is not nearly as dense as the ACM
conference format, so this may be very hard to achieve, and we may
have to include only five papers.

Each paper will be reviewed by two `readers' among the other
contributors, and by one external reviewer.  As all papers have been
reviewed for PEPM already, we do not expect major revisions to be
needed.

Reviewers and authors should strive to achieve maximal soundness and
clarity (and brevity) in the published papers.


Schedule
--------

We suggest the following schedule.  Please tell us NOW if you know
this is going to be impossible for you:

Before September 15, 
    readers send comments to authors, based on the proceedings version.
    Meanwhile, authors should try to typeset their papers with the LASC
    style (see below) to figure out how long they will be.

Before November 1, 
    authors revise their papers and send them to readers and to Peter and
    Harald for a quick check.  Note: Peter is at AT&T Bell Labs in New
    Jersey by that time; the usual e-mail address should continue to work.

Before November 15, 
    readers (and Peter and Harald) send back brief comments to authors.

Before December 1, 
    authors send final versions of their papers (in Latex source form) to
    Peter, who forwards them to LASC with preface etc. immediately after
    receiving the last one.

The six suggested papers and the assigned readers are:

Paper (first author)	Readers
-----------------------------------------------
Birkedal		Danvy, Jones
Danvy			Birkedal, Jones
Jones			Danvy, Birkedal 

Baker-Finch		Davis, Courtenage
Courtenage		Baker-Finch, Davis
Davis			Baker-Finch, Courtenage

(Authors of multi-author papers may share the reader jobs).


LASC style file for Latex
-------------------------
The LASC style file smjrnl.sty can be obtained as follows:

          ftp ftp.std.com 
          Name: ftp
          password: your e-mail address 

          cd Kluwer/styles/journals 
          get README
	  get smjrnl.sty

	  Read the README file, then get other files as necessary.

Since LASC is a `small format journal', it suffices to get,
uncompress, and untar the file

	ftp.std.com:Kluwer/styles/journals/smjstyles.tar.Z

It contains the style file, documentation, an article template, a
sample article, and the README file.

The faster you act, the sooner your paper will be published!

Best regards,
Harald and Peter

Thanks very much for your comments; I will certainly take them on board.

For your own interest I'll respond to a few here.

It's no problem, but I need to explain this.

The -> operator on relations (or predicates viewed as relations) constructs
a relation on functions.  I just need to explain this.

I learned the same term at the same place; I'll mention it as well.

You're right.

Superficially, John's is the more similar.  There is a subtlety
that I would argue makes it the less similar.  I'll just mention
both; to show the subtlety requires some work.

Thanks again.

Dear Kei,

Here are my comments on your PEPM paper.

Peter

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kei Davis: PERs from Projections for Binding-Time Analysis

The paper is well presented but somewhat terse.  With a little
previous knowledge of projection-based analysis, I found it mostly
readable, although I won't claim to have understood every detail.

The `Introduction and Background' is very neat, and Section 2 needs no
improvement.  Section 3 becomes very technical immediately; here it
would be helpful to give an example of the domain factorization, which
is a central point, *before* embarking on the formal definitions, and
perhaps to advertise also the examples of program analysis in Section
6, which is indispensable.

* Section 2.1: Where is the conception of Int as an infinite sum used?
Elsewhere, including Figure 1, infinite sums aren't permitted.  Is
this a problem?

* Section 4, the Central Result: I can't make sense of the assertion

	((R[Int] * R[Int]) -> R[Int])(plus^P,plus^S,plus^S).  

Namely, in the definition of R[T], the first argument must be a pair,
but plus^P as defined in Figure 5 is a *function* from pairs to pairs.

* Section 5: The projections considered are those called "admissible"
by Launchbury, I think. 

The admissible projections on recursively defined data could be called
"uniform" (on the recursive components of the same type).

* Section 6: I suppose that the projection SPINE BOT just says that
the whole spine is defined, and does not exclude infinite lists.  So
the analysis result for `length' says that provided the spine of xs is
static and provided length(xs) terminates, the result is static.  This
is the usual interpretation of binding-times, but worth saying
explicitly for readers who are used to finite data structures only.
 
* Section 7: Is the $\sqcap-basis$ uniquely determined?

* Section 8: Rather than [Consel:90:BindingTime] it seems relevant to
cite [Hughes:88:Backwards], and especially his Section 6.3 which
introduces a similar factorization of the abstract domain into a
`backwards' (~projection) and an `abstract interpretation' (~forwards)
part.  As far as I know, John hasn't further developed that work.

@Inproceedings{ Hughes:88:Backwards,
  AUTHOR        = "J. Hughes",
  TITLE         = "Backwards Analysis of Functional Programs",

  PAGES         = "187-208",
  PUBLISHER     = "Amsterdam:\ North-Holland",
  YEAR          = "1988"}


MISPRINTS:

* Abstract: `that projections' --> `than projections' 

* Section 1: `safety condition satisfies, and' --> `safety condition,' 

  `technique far simpler technique' -->   `technique far simpler'

* Section 4: The `\alpha_1, \alpha_2,' in the proof outline for the
central result should be deleted.

* Section 5: `$FTran_{T_1}$' should be `$FProj_{T_1}$' (twice), in the
inference rule.

* Section 6: `denote usual' --> `denote the usual'

Kei,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
`PERs from projections for binding-time analysis' -- Kei Davis.


My initial reaction was that the paper assumes quite a deep background
knowledge of projection-based analyses and that little consideration is
given to the more general reader.  On reflection, constraints on length
and common sense suggest that rewriting to suit a larger target audience
is unreasonable.  Nevertheless, I think more space could be devoted to
the PER correspondence and its import.


Some more particular comments and queries (If they demonstrate my lack
of understanding, perhaps you should take them as possibly indicating
a need for clarification):

section 2.2.
I don't understand why products are unlifted.  It apparently happens by
subterfuge through taking separated sums -- in most cases at least.

Section 4.
This is pretty tough going, especially with the definition of R[[T]]
left hanging for almost a page before we see the point.  All that kept
me going was that it looked like a PER so I had some intuitions to fall
back on.  Perhaps a hint of where you are heading at the start of this
section.

section 5.
I don't see the comparison with BHA strictness analysis.  Isn't the
double lifting tied up with the different kind (or amount) of
information that is represented?  (I admit that I don't know much about
the reversal relation between strictness and binding time analysis, so
maybe that's my problem.)

One of your rules defining fabsf refers to projection transformers (I
presume?).  That is: \tau_1 \in FTran_T_1.

Section 6.
Thank goodness for these well-chosen and well-explained examples!

Here are my comments on your PEPM '94 paper.

Kei

-------------------------------------------------------------------

S. A. Courtenage and C. D. Clack
Analysing resource use in the lambda calculus by type inference.

GENERAL COMMENTS

1.  The theory appears sound and worthwhile.

2.  It is very hard going, for reasons spanning many levels, from
    general content through typesetting.

The conclusion is that the paper is intrinsically worthwhile, but
requires a great deal of work to shape up.

---------

It is difficult to determine precisely what is new here; how good
the proposed analysis is (e.g. how close to optimal are real 
results (no examples are given) in the proposed domain U; how
realistic "potentially subsume analyses for strictness, sharing,
and single-threading..." is.  More generally, the paper seems
to suffer a lack of context, and assumes that the reader will
deduce the real-world significance.  The references are plentiful
and appropriate, but the reader cannot be expected to have read
any of them to be able to get a clear picture of what's going on.
(I've read about half, otherwise I'd probably be hopelessly lost.)

How much does this build on BKK86?  This is not to imply that
differences or improvements are necessary to justify the paper
(presumable the main goal is "key insights into its semantics"),
but some discussion of the differences would be useful.


----------

PARTICULARS (in roughly textual order, at no particular level of
             abstraction)

Abstract

The concept of arguments as resources is presumably meant to
abstract space/time/whatever in an implementation; beyond using
the suggestive term "resource" this is never made clear.

"resource use properties" should be "resource-use properties".
Throughout the paper there are numerous missing hypens, and
numerous incorrectly-placed hyphens (e.g. term model usually,
but not always, appears as "term-model").  Similarly for commas.


1.  Introduction

"more optimal" like "more unique"?

I'd argue that there are three general approaches:  non-standard
(abstract) denotational semantics, static (type) semantics, and
operational semantics.

Capitalisation is very much overused, e.g. Abstract Interpretation.


2.  Background

"PR in \lambda x.(P R)"  application should be immediate juxtaposition
or space, not randomly one or the other.

"i.e." should be "i.e.\ " -- see Latex book.  There are perhaps
hundreds of typesetting errors, e.g. math italics in subscripts giving
incorrect spacing, spacing after italics.  Again, read the Latex book.

"Models provide ... a semantics"  singular or plural.  Generally, many
incorrect prepositions, e.g. "useful to our purpose".


3.  Neededness and usage...

3.1  Neededness ...

Definition 3.1 : "traced back" is not clear at all.
"in M' are those sub-terms with" of M'?
"same pair of outermost brackets"  confusing
The entire definition is not very clear.  On typesetting,
I do not find the reversion of emphasis to ordinary text
from italics (a Latex fault, in my opinion) to be helpful
at all.  Better not to italicise definitions etc. in
the first place.

Define the combinators I and K for the reader.  Also S later.

"Corollary" of "definitions"?

"We could adopt ..."  Finally, some clear insight!

"However, a more interesting..."  Should be part of the
previous paragraph.

"it is used"  should be "whether it is used".

"simple strictness analysis" is not an "optimisation"--it's
just an analysis.

"In this case, the packet of (SKK) = ..." is "=" a pun for "is"?

"Packets of needed ... form"  This seems to contradict the SKK
example preceeding.  Did I miss something?

|R|=\bottom  So you mean the domain of integers?  With a top
of infinity?  (Referring to Table 1.)

Notation 3.1  |R|\in MR  bizarre notation.
Generally, the paper is pretty heavy on non-standard (or perhaps
exceedingly specialised) notation

Lemma 3.2 use parentheses.

Proof 3.2  "Obvious."  Perhaps, if I fully understood all of
the preceeding.

Lemma 3.3 use parentheses.


3.2 Neededness ...

"persistent"  Is the following sentence a definition?


\forall Y \in ...  can't parse at all.

[M]\cdot [R]  what is the operation \cdot?  Just application?


3.3 Usage in the lambda calculus

0+
1+
etc.  Does infinity belong here?

"Both the operators $\plus" and * defined...  I must have
missed the definitions for packets referred to.

By now I'm dazed.  The paper needs a very careful going-through.

Kei,

Thank you for your comments.

On your paper, I've been trying unsuccessfully to read it , since I
know very little about projections and nothing about PERs.  Hence,
there is little I can say that is constructive.  I will say, however,
that it is terse and hard to read.  I found the derivation of results
concluded rather obscurely, particularly the realtionship between your
work and the PER technique (this is result that the relation R is a
PER?)  In the introduction, you don't mention that the abstract
domains you build compare favourably with those from BHA strictness
analysis, which is certainly one of the results of the paper.

There is a typo in Figure 2: function application appears twice.

On the definition of R, the first clause for integers appears to be
parameterised by a three-tuple, but this doesn't appear in the
subsequent clauses - perhaps this is deliberate?

But generally, very hard to read.  Unfortunately, you don't have much
space for the journal version, otherwise I would recommend a review
section at the beginning to introduce projections for b/time analysis
in greater depth.

Simon

Dear Authors,

We have now received a suitable number of reports on the PEPM papers
for the special issue of Lisp and Symbolic Computation.

Unfortunately we had to leave out one paper, which was promising but
not yet in a form suitable for rapid journal publication.

However, (1) your paper made it into the special issue, and (2) the
page limit on your paper now is 19 pages (strictly), instead of the 16
previously announced.  If you haven't yet done so, you should format
your paper to see how long it is with the LASC style file.

Harald and Peter

Peter,

I'm soon to send you my paper.  Do you want (compressed/uuencoded) dvi?
Postscript?  Self-contained LaTeX?  I assume Kluwer will want self-contained
latex as there is a section in the sample they want to fill in.  Correct?

Looks like my paper will only be 17 pages, so there's room for more
examples and explanation if your quick check reveals the need.  I've
addressed all of the issues in your referee's report.

Sounds good.  Eventually we need self-contained Latex, but for now
Postscript will do fine.

I look forward to seeing your paper.

I find this to be a good paper; you have added more explanation in the
right places, and I could follow it more easily than last time.

Would it be possible to further clarify the relation to John Hughes's
approach, mentioned at the end of Section 8?  E.g., for
projection-based analysis, would he have to lift values to functions,
or in what sense would it be more similar to your previous work.  Just
a few sentences would be helpful.

Peter

`Eventually' (that is, with the final revised paper around December 1)
is fine.

Good you reminded me of this question.  We will need the Latex source,
since that's what the journal asks for; I shall tell the other authors
also.

Kei,


We now have the final versions of all five LASC papers.  Thanks for
your efforts.  Now we send them off to Robert Kessler (LASC editor)
for a final check before sending them to Kluwer (the publisher).

We did some checking and editing of bibliographies, and encourage you
to check that we did not introduce new problems.

Regards,

Harald and Peter
