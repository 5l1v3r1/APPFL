PERS FROM PROJECTIONS FOR BINDING-TIME ANALYSIS

Kei Davis

Abstract:

Launchbury has shown that first-order projection-based binding-time
analysis is genuinely useful in partial evaluation.  There have been
three notable generalisations of his analysis technique to higher
order.  The first, due to Mogensen, lacked a formal basis. The second,
Hunt and Sands', used structures strictly more general that
projections, namely partial equivalence relations (PERs).  The third,
ours, involved a complex construction that gave rise to impractically
large abstract domains.  This paper presents a technique free of these
shortcomings:  it is simple, entirely projection-based, satisfies a
formal correctness condition, and gives rise to reasonably small
abstract domains.  Though the technique is cast in terms of
projections, there is also an interpretation in terms of PERs.  The
principal limitation of the technique is the restriction to monomorphic
typing.
