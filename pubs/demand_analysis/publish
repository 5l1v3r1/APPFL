Dear Clem, Kei, Lars, Mark, Olivier, and Simon,

As already indicated, we have an agreement with the editors (Carolyn
Talcott and Bob Kessler) of the journal Lisp and Symbolic Computation
(LASC) to publish a special issue based on papers from PEPM'94.
Harald and I will be guest editors, and will organize the refereeing
and do the selection.

LASC has offered favourable conditions, which means that if we can
revise the papers and produce the final papers in Latex form quickly,
then we can have the special issue published with a minimal delay
(even skipping other special issues which are in the pipeline).

We hope to include six papers (listed below), but this allows only 16
PAGES PER PAPER.  The LASC format is not nearly as dense as the ACM
conference format, so this may be very hard to achieve, and we may
have to include only five papers.

Each paper will be reviewed by two `readers' among the other
contributors, and by one external reviewer.  As all papers have been
reviewed for PEPM already, we do not expect major revisions to be
needed.

Reviewers and authors should strive to achieve maximal soundness and
clarity (and brevity) in the published papers.


Schedule
--------

We suggest the following schedule.  Please tell us NOW if you know
this is going to be impossible for you:

Before September 15, 
    readers send comments to authors, based on the proceedings version.
    Meanwhile, authors should try to typeset their papers with the LASC
    style (see below) to figure out how long they will be.

Before November 1, 
    authors revise their papers and send them to readers and to Peter and
    Harald for a quick check.  Note: Peter is at AT&T Bell Labs in New
    Jersey by that time; the usual e-mail address should continue to work.

Before November 15, 
    readers (and Peter and Harald) send back brief comments to authors.

Before December 1, 
    authors send final versions of their papers (in Latex source form) to
    Peter, who forwards them to LASC with preface etc. immediately after
    receiving the last one.

The six suggested papers and the assigned readers are:

Paper (first author)	Readers
-----------------------------------------------
Birkedal		Danvy, Jones
Danvy			Birkedal, Jones
Jones			Danvy, Birkedal 

Baker-Finch		Davis, Courtenage
Courtenage		Baker-Finch, Davis
Davis			Baker-Finch, Courtenage

(Authors of multi-author papers may share the reader jobs).


LASC style file for Latex
-------------------------
The LASC style file smjrnl.sty can be obtained as follows:

          ftp ftp.std.com 
          Name: ftp
          password: your e-mail address 

          cd Kluwer/styles/journals 
          get README
	  get smjrnl.sty

	  Read the README file, then get other files as necessary.

Since LASC is a `small format journal', it suffices to get,
uncompress, and untar the file

	ftp.std.com:Kluwer/styles/journals/smjstyles.tar.Z

It contains the style file, documentation, an article template, a
sample article, and the README file.

The faster you act, the sooner your paper will be published!

Best regards,
Harald and Peter
