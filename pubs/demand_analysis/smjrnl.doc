\chapter{Using the Kluwer\\ Small Journal Style File}
\vskip1sp
\vskip-24pt

\noindent
Welcome to the use of the Kluwer \LaTeX\ journal style file for the
production of articles in small size Kluwer journals!

You will find that most of the
commands found in the \LaTeX\ book will work exactly the same when
you use this style file. The few new commands specifically for
this journal style
will be explained here, followed
by a set of sample pages. Each sample page is preceded by 
a page with the \LaTeX\ code that produced it, so that you
can quickly compare the code with the results. This should 
make it easy to
format your article correctly.

\subsection{Current Version}
Please make sure that you have the current version of the macro files
and the documentation. You can do this by ftp'ing the README file from
the directory /Kluwer/styles/journals at world.std.com and checking
the dates to see if you do have the most recent version of the files.

If you find that you are having a problem {\bf after you have read
this documentation carefully}, help may be had by sending email
to Suzanne Rumsey at {\tt prod@world.std.com}. If possible, please send a
small file demonstrating the problem.

\section{The Sample File}
The sample file, smjsamp.tex, is an example of the commands
being used in a complete sample article. 
The text of the smjsamp.tex is also used in the final
pages of this documenation, so it might seem that having a sample
file is redundant, but it will be useful
for those who prefer an on-line file for examples of macros in use.



\section{The Template File}
A template file, smjtmpl.tex is provided to make it
easier to enter the the initial article commands in the correct order.
It should be self-explanatory. After the \verb+\end{document}+
in the template file
you will see a list of other commands you might want
to use while formatting your article.

You are strongly urged to use this file!

\section{Starting Your Article}
We suggest that you start by copying and renaming the smjtmpl.tex
file. Use this new file as the basis of the format of your article.

Near the top of your new file you will see the
\verb+\documentstyle+ command used.  You must choose whether
you want to use the optional style for PostScript fonts.

\begin{verbatim}
% Use one of these two commands: 
\documentstyle{smjrnl} % For Computer Modern Fonts
% or,
% \documentstyle[smjfonts]{smjrnl} % for PostScript fonts
\end{verbatim}

The article will eventually be printed in PostScript so if
it is important for you to check line breaks and you do have
PostScript fonts available, you might want to use the smjfonts
optional style file. If you choose to use the PostScript fonts, 
you may have to edit smjfonts.sty file. This is because there
are differing conventions for the name of the same PostScript
fonts.  For instance, if you are working on a Mac, you will
have to rename the fonts to match those on the Mac. (The default
version of the font names are those used by the Arbortext driver for
IBM compatible machines).

You will then see the commands to start the document and to
start the article.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{document}
\begin{article}
\end{verbatim}

You will notice the following section of
the file is reserved for Kluwers, where you will see this:

\begin{verbatim}
%%%%% To be entered at Kluwers: =====>>
\end{verbatim}

You don't have to enter anything until you see these lines:

\begin{verbatim}
%%%%% <<==== End of commands to be entered at Kluwers 

%%  Authors, start here ====>>
\end{verbatim}

\eject

The text of your article will start with the title, author name or names,
and other title information:


\begin{verbatim}
%%  Authors, start here ====>>

\title{}

%% Author name 
\authors{}

%% Email address. Do not delete this command even if you do not have
%% an email address; just leave the command followed by facing curly brackets.
\email{} 

%% Affiliation address
\affil{}

%% Article editor
\editor{}

%% Abstract
\abstract{}

%% Keywords
\keywords{}
...
\end{verbatim}

These commands are self-explanatory with the following exceptions. There
are a number of different ways you can set up the title block:

\begin{itemize}
\item
You can get a new line in the title or affiliation with `\verb+\\+'

\item
You can use \verb+\thanks{}+ in the title line if you wish to
have an acknowledgement appear on the title page of the article. 

\item
You do not need to enter an email address, though you are
encouraged to do so. If you do not want to enter an email
address, please leave the command with an empty argument:
\verb+\email{}+

\item
You can use as many separate author names and affiliations as
you need.

\item
You can use the command \verb+\technicalnote+ before \verb+title+
if that is appropriate for your article.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection{Sample Title Block Setup}
Here are some samples and results so that you can see your choices:

You can start a new line in the title or affiliation with the use of
`\verb+\\+'

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\title{Explorations of an Incremental,\\ Bayesian Algorithm\\
for Categorization}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\vskip-24pt\vskip1sp
\title{Explorations of an Incremental,\\ Bayesian Algorithm\\
for Categorization}
\endresults



Now, here are some differing ways to specify authors and
affiliations:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\title{Explorations of an Incremental, Bayesian Algorithm
for Categorization\thanks{We would like to thank our funding sources.}}

\authors{John R. Anderson and Michael Matessa}
\email{ja\o s@andrew.cmu.edu}

\affil{Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh,
PA 15213}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\results
\vskip-24pt
\title{Explorations of an Incremental, Bayesian Algorithm
for Categorization\raise.3ex\hbox{*}}

\authors{John R. Anderson and Michael Matessa}
\email{ja\o s@andrew.cmu.edu}

\affil{Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh,
PA 15213}
\vskip18pt
...
\vskip 18pt
\footnoterule
\noindent
\raise.5ex\hbox{*}We would like to thank our funding sources.
\endresults

\newpage

The following example shows several authors with different affiliations.
(By the way, the commands \verb+\author+ and \verb+\authors+ produce
the same results.)

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\title{Bayesian Method for the Induction of\\ 
Probabilistic Networks form Data}

\author{Gregory F. Cooper}
\email{gfc@med.pitt.edu}

\affil{Section of Medical Informatics, 
Department of Medicine, 
University of Pittsburgh,\\ B50A Lothrop Hall,
Pittsburgh, PA 15261}

\author{Edward Herskovits}
\email{ehh@sumex-aim.stanford.edu}

\affil{Noetic Systems, Incorporated, 2504 Maryland Avenue, 
Baltimore, MD 21218}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\vskip-12pt
\title{Bayesian Method for the Induction of\\ 
Probabilistic Networks form Data}

\author{Gregory F. Cooper}
\email{gfc@med.pitt.edu}

\affil{Section of Medical Informatics, 
Department of Medicine, 
University of Pittsburgh,\\ B50A Lothrop Hall,
Pittsburgh, PA 15261}

\author{Edward Herskovits}
\email{ehh@sumex-aim.stanford.edu}

\affil{Noetic Systems, Incorporated, 2504 Maryland Avenue, 
Baltimore, MD 21218}
\endresults

\newpage
Or, you can have two authors with separate email addresses,
and the same affiliation:
\code
\begin{verbatim}
\title{A Framework for Average Case Analysis of\\ Conjunctive 
Learning Algorithms}

\author{Michael J. Pazzani}
\email{pizzani@ics.uci.edu}

\author{Wendy Sarrett}
\email{sarrett@ics.uci.edu}

\affil{Department of Information and Computer Science,
University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\title{A Framework for Average Case Analysis of\\ Conjunctive 
Learning Algorithms}

\author{Wendy Sarrett}
\email{sarrett@ics.uci.edu}

\affil{Department of Information and Computer Science,
University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA}
\endresults


Finally, if your paper is a Technical Note, you can use the
following command:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\technicalnote
\title{First Nearest Neighbor Classification on Frey
and\\
Slate's Letter Recognition Problem}

\author{Terence C. Fogarty}
\email{TC\lower1ex\hbox{---}fogar@uk.ac.bristol-poly.csd}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\technicalnote
\title{First Nearest Neighbor Classification on Frey
and\\
Slate's Letter Recognition Problem}

\author{Terence C. Fogarty}
\email{TC\lower1ex\hbox{---}fogar@uk.ac.bristol-poly.csd}
\endresults
\newpage
\section{Making Sections}

Making section heads is totally straight-forward:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\section{This is a section head}
\subsection{This is a subsection head}
\subsubsection{This is a subsubsection head}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\vskip-12pt
\vskip1sp
\savesection{This is a section head}
\savesubsection{This is a subsection head}
\subsubsection{This is a subsubsection head}
\endresults



\section{Making Equations}
Equations are made as they normally are in \LaTeX, but this
style also offers several new options.

The Kluwer journal style will place the equation 24 points
indented from the left margin:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\[
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)
\]
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\[
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)
\]
\endresults

If you have an equation that needs the full width of
the page to fit, use the command \verb+\begin{wideequation}+ before
\verb+\begin{equation}+:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{wideequation}
\begin{equation}
\sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2
\sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2
\end{equation}
\end{wideequation}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\begin{wideequation}
\begin{equation}
\sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2
\sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2
\end{equation}
\end{wideequation}
\endresults
\newpage
You may have an equation that you need to split into
two parts. Then use 

\verb+\begin{splitmath} <top line>\\ <bottom line> \end{splitmath}+

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{splitmath}
a \sum_k 
P(k) \sum_i\sum_y f_i(y|k)^2\\
a_1 \sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2 
 \sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2 
\end{splitmath}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\results
\begin{splitmath}
a \sum_k 
P(k) \sum_i\sum_y f_i(y|k)^2\\
a_1 \sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2 
 \sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2 
\end{splitmath}
\endresults

 If you want the two parts to overlap, add an ampersand to
the top line at the horizontal point where you would like the 
bottom line to start:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{splitmath}
a \sum_k 
&
P(k) \sum_i\sum_y f_i(y|k)^2\\
a_1 \sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2 
 \sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2 
\end{splitmath}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\results
\begin{splitmath}
a \sum_k 
&
P(k) \sum_i\sum_y f_i(y|k)^2\\
a_1 \sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2 
 \sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2 
\end{splitmath}
\endresults
\newpage
\subsection{Lettered Equations}
You may want to letter some equations,  keeping the equation
numbers from advancing. You can do this with the command
\verb+\mathletter{<letter>}+:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
Unlettered equation,
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)
\end{equation}

Lettered equation,
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{a}
\end{equation}

Second lettered equation
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{b}
\end{equation}

Unlettered equation
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
Unlettered equation,
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)
\end{equation}

Lettered equation,
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{a}
\end{equation}

Second lettered equation
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{b}
\end{equation}

Unlettered equation
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)
\end{equation}
\endresults

\newpage
To use letters with eqnarray:


\code
\begin{verbatim}
Formally, this amounts to calculating:
\begin{eqnarray}
g_i(y|f)&=&\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{a}\\
g_2(y|f)&=&\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{b}\\
g_3(y|f)&=&\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{c}\\
g_4(y|f)&=&\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)
\end{eqnarray}
where $g_i(y|F_n)$ is the function specifying...
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results

\endresults

\subsection{Boldface in Math}
In the default \LaTeX\ style, as in book.sty for example, 
bold in math does not change sizes in sub and superscripts. The
Kluwer small journal style
will make that change automatic.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\[\bf X^{Y^Z}\] 
\end{verbatim}
\results
\[\bf X^{Y^Z}\] 
\endresults

\newpage

\section{Footnotes}
Footnotes are entered as they are normally in \LaTeX:

\begin{verbatim}
text.\footnote{This is a footnote} ...
\end{verbatim}

The footnote number will appear in text, but the footnote
itself will appear at the end of the article.

You can also use the command \verb+\footnotetext{<text...>}+.
In this case, no footnote number will appear but the text of the
footnote will also appear in the end notes section at the end of
the article.

\section{Indented Text and Lists}
The Kluwer Journal style uses standard \LaTeX\ methods to
produce indented text and lists. Following are some examples
of the results in this style.

\subsection{To Indent Text:}

\code
\begin{verbatim}

If an example satisfies the seed of a clause, then it satisfies the clause
as well. In addition, seeds have the following property:

\begin{itemize}
\item[] 
If a seed of clause $c_T$, and example {\bf x} satisfies $c_T$ but
not $c$, then {\bf x} has at least one attibute in $c_T$ that
is not in $c$.\hfill({\tt*})
\end{itemize}
The procedure below...
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results

The procedure below...
\endresults

\newpage
\subsection{Bulleted List}
Here is an example of a bulleted list:
\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item

\endresults
\newpage
\subsection{Numbered and Lettered List}

\section{To Illustrate an Algorithm}

This is the command to use when you want to illustrate an algorithm
with some pseudo code. A backslash followed with a space will
indent the line. Every line will be printed
as it is seen on the screen. Blank lines will be preserved.
Math and font changes may be used. 

You can also use \verb+\label{xxx}+ to reference a particular
line in the code.

If you want to break lines on the screen but not break the line
in the results, use `\%' at the end of line, as you see in
the fifth line in this example.

The command
\verb+\bit+ will produce bold italics if you are using PostScript fonts, 
boldface in Computer Modern. \verb+\note{}+ will position the
note on the right margin. A backslash followed by a space
will provide a space a bit wider than the width of 2 `M's.


\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{algorithm}
{\bit Evaluate-Single-FOE} ({\bf x$_f$, I$_0$, I$_1$}):
\ {\bf I}+ := {\bf I}$_1$;\label{algo-second-line}
\ ($\phi,\theta$) := (0,0);
\ {\it repeat}\note{/*usually only 1 interation required*/}
\ \ (s$_{opt}${\bf E}$_\eta$) := {\bit Optimal-Shift} %
       ({\bf I$_0$,I$^+$,I$_0$,x$_f$});
\ \ ($\phi^+$, $\theta^+$) := {\bit Equivalent-Rotation} ({\bf s}$_{opt}$);
\ \ ($\phi$, $\theta$) := ($\phi$, $\theta$) + ($\phi^+$, $\theta^+$);
\ \ {\bf I}$^+$:= {\bit Derotate-Image} ({\bf I}$_1$, $\phi$, $\theta$);
\ \ {\it until} ($|\phi^+|\leq\phi_{max}$ \& $|\theta^+|\leq\theta_{max}$);
\ {\it return} ({\bf I}$^+$, $\phi$, $\theta$, E$_\eta$).
End pseudo-code.

As you can see in line \ref{algo-second-line}, we are ...

\section{Figure Captions}
Here is an example of a figure with .5 inch space left for
the illustration:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace*{.5in}
\caption{This is a figure caption.
This is a figure caption.
This is a figure caption.}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\spresults
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace*{.5in}
\caption{This is a figure caption.
This is a figure caption.
This is a figure caption.}
\end{figure}
\endspresults

\subsection{Figure placement}

There are some problems with figure placement that have nothing
to do with this particular package, but are due to the LaTeX
figure placement algorithm.
 
If you find that you have problems with figures floating to the end of the 
article, there are two things you can do to help:

Don't ask for a particular placement; write
\verb+\begin{figure}+ instead of \verb+\begin{figure}[h]+ etc.
Especially difficult for LaTeX is the \verb+\begin{figure}[p]+ 
command, which may force all the subsequent figures 
to the end of the article to be positioned after the
full page figure.

If you ask for a particular placement you can also ask
La\TeX\ to use all the figures it is holding back with the command
\verb+\clearpage+.
This command will also start
a new page so you must use it only at a point in the text
where a new page should start---a point that can only be
determined with some experimentation. 

\newpage
\subsection{Lettered figure and table captions}
The Kluwer macros give you the opportunity to use a letter with
your caption number. The resulting number/letter combination can
be cross-referenced. 

The new command to use is
\verb+\letteredcapion{<letter>}{<caption>}+.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{Lettered figure caption.}
\label{figure1a}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{b}{Lettered figure caption.}
\label{figure1b}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Normal figure caption.}
\label{normalfig}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\spresults

\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{Lettered figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\vskip-24pt
\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{b}{Lettered figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\vskip-24pt
\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Normal figure caption.}
\end{figure}
\vskip-24pt
\endspresults

And, of course, this works just the same for table captions:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{A short table caption.}
<actual table>
\label{table1a}
\end{table}
\noindent Showing references: first lettered table is \ref{table1a}, first 
lettered figure is \ref{figure1a}, second lettered figure is \ref{figure1b}.
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\spresults
\begin{table}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{A short table caption.}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr
\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}\noindent
Showing references: first lettered table is 1a, first 
lettered figure is 1a, second lettered figure is 1b.
\endspresults
\clearpage

\section{Making Tables}
There are two aspects of making tables with this macro package
that need mentioning. 

First, you need to enter commands
as you see in the section `Normal Tables' below, in order to have the
table have the correct appearance. 

Second, since these table macros are made to make it easy to
make normal tables, you must go to some extra effort if you
want to make more unusual tables, for instance, 
if you want to nest `tabular' within other `tabular's,
or if you want to use vertical lines. Please see the
examples in the section `Unusual Tables,' following the
next section.

\subsection{Normal Tables}
In order to make your table conform to the Kluwer Journal
specification you must follow several steps.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Use caption on top of the table. 

\item
Use \verb+\hline+ at the top of the table, underneath the column headers
and at the end of the table.

\item
You are discouraged from using vertical lines in tables, but
it you must include vertical lines, you must also use 
\verb+\savehline+ instead of \verb+\hline+ or there will be a
gap between the vertical and horizontal lines.
(\verb+\hline+ has been redefined to add some vertical space above and
below it.)

\item
Make your table span the full page width if possible.
\end{itemize}

The following example shows these steps being followed and the
form of the table preamble that will cause the table
to spread out to the width of the page:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{This is an example table caption. As you can
see, it will be as wide as the table that it captions.}
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lcr}
\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr
\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr
\hline
\end{tabular*}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\spresults
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{This is an example table caption. As you can
see, it will be as wide as the table that it captions.}
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lcr}
\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr
\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr
\hline
\end{tabular*}
\end{table}
\endspresults



The caption will adjust to the width of the table:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{This is a table caption and will fit
the width of the table that it is captioning.}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr
\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\spresults
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{This is a table caption and will fit
the width of the table that it is captioning.}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr
\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\endspresults

\clearpage

\subsection{Unusual Tables}
There are three cases in which authors have felt the need to
make a table other than the plain `tabular' table in this style.
These more unusual tables are: tables with vertical lines;
tables that do not use `tabular'; and tables that have
a number of `tabular's nested. In this section we will show
how to make these tables.

\vskip12pt
{\it Vertical Lines}

Notice in the previous examples that no vertical lines were used.
If at all possible to make your meaning clear without vertical
lines, please leave them out. However, if you really must use
vertical lines, you must use \verb+\savehline+ instead of
\verb+\hline+ and
you must add another letter to the preamble.

For instance, this is the effect we usually want; 
horizontal lines extending to
the edge of the text in the column:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{c}\hline
 A         \\ \hline
 B         \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\spresults
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{c}\hline
 A         \\ \hline
 B         \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\vskip-24pt
\endspresults

Since we usually do not want vertical
lines in tables and we do want the horizontal lines to extend
exactly to the left and right of text, 
we must go to some extra efforts to get the vertical lines
to extend to the top and bottom of the column and to not
have extra horizontal space to the right of the vertical line
in the last column.
Remember to
use \verb+\savehline+ and to
to add another column entry to the table preamble
and then not to use that column, as seen below:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c}\savehline
 A         \\ \savehline
 B         \\ \savehline
\end{tabular}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\results
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c}\savehline
 A         \\ \savehline
 B         \\ \savehline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\endresults
\clearpage

{\it Table Made Without `tabular'}

To make a table that does not include a `tabular' table, please
use the commands \verb+\begin{specialtable}+, \verb+\end{specialtable}+.
You can follow \verb+\begin{specialtable}+ with a positioning command
in square brackets, just
as you can with \verb+\begin{table}+; \verb+\begin{specialtable}[h]+ etc.
Here is an example of a table made without `tabular.' Note
that the caption must be written above the table.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{specialtable}[h]
\caption{Training a Thermal Linear Machine.}
\label{thermal-alg}
\hrule width 30pc
\vskip3pt
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initialize $\beta$ to $2$.

  \item If linear machine is correct for all instances or 
  $emag/lmag < \alpha$ for the last $2*n$ instances, then return
  ($n =$ the number of features).

  \item Otherwise, pass through the training instances once, and for each 
  instance ${\bf Y}$ that would be misclassified by the linear machine and 
  for which $k < \beta$, immediately
	\begin{enumerate}
        \item Compute correction $c = \frac{\beta^{2}}{\beta+k}$, and update
              ${\bf W}_{i}$ and  ${\bf W}_{j}$.

	  \item If the magnitude of the linear machine decreased on this
		adjustment, but increased on the previous adjustment, then
		anneal $\beta$ to $a \beta - b$. 
	\end{enumerate}

  \item Go to step 2.
\end{enumerate}
\vskip1pt
\hrule width 30pc
\vskip6pt

\end{verbatim}
\endcode

{\it Nesting `Tabular's}

The table macros are made to automatically format the
caption so that it is the width of the table and the caption
appears at the top of the table. This works fine as long
as you use the normal \verb+\begin{tabular}..+ 
to make your
table, and you don't nest another \verb+\begin{tabular}..+ with it. 
However, if you want to nest one or more tabulars within
the table, you must start with \verb+\begin{specialtable}+, as you
see in the example below.
Note that the caption must be given at the top of the table.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{specialtable}[h]
\caption{Quantitative and qualitative descriptions}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}& Quantitative & Qualitative \\ \hline & & \\(a) & 
    \begin{tabular}{rr} {\it Time} &
     {\it Level}\\ \hline 3 sec. & 0.01 m\\ 4 sec. & 0.23 m\\ 5 sec. &
     0.31 m\\ \hline
    \end{tabular} & 
           \begin{tabular}{c}$ Level(between(t_1, t_2)) = $\\ \ \ \ \ $
              (between(zero,top), increasing)$\\
           \end{tabular}\\& & \\(b) & $ Amount = 2.5 * 
                    Level + 0.7 * Level ^2 $ & $ Amount =M^+(Level) $\\
                    & & \\  \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tabqq}
\end{specialtable}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\spresults
\begin{specialtable}[h]

    \end{tabular} & 
           \begin{tabular}{c}$ Level(between(t_1, t_2)) = $\\ \ \ \ \ $
              (between(zero,top), increasing)$\\
           \end{tabular}\\& & \\(b) & $ Amount = 2.5 * 
                    Level + 0.7 * Level ^2 $ & $ Amount =M^+(Level) $\\

\section{Theorems, Proofs, Examples and Similar Environments}
To make a theorem type statement,
you can use either the standard \LaTeX\ theorem environment or use
the command \verb+\begin{proclaim}{}+. The standard \LaTeX\
method has the advantage of automatic numbering and
cross-referencing capability. The Proclaim command, on the other
hand, allows the author to supply his/her own numbers which some
authors may prefer. 

\subsection{Using \LaTeX\ theorem type environments}
Following is an example of a theorem using the standard
\LaTeX\ syntax. It also demonstrates a sample cross-reference.
Notice the \verb+\openbox+ command used in the proof environment
used to produce \qed\ rather than \slug. The default is \slug.


\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{theorem}
This is our theorem.
\label{first}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
And here is our proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
And here is our proof.\openbox
\end{proof}

Here the first theorem is referenced: \ref{first}.
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\begin{theorem}
This is our theorem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
And here is our proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
And here is our proof.\openbox
\end{proof}

Here the first theorem is referenced: [1].
\endresults
\newpage


The small journal format also supplies a theorem environment for
lemma, corollary, proposition and claim, used similarly:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{lemma}
This is a lemma.
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
This is a corollary.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}
This is a proposition.
\end{proposition}

\begin{claim}
This is a claim.
\end{claim}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\begin{lemma}
This is a lemma.
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
This is a corollary.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}
This is a proposition.
\end{proposition}

\begin{claim}
This is a claim.
\end{claim}
\endresults

\subsection{Making your own theorem environment}
If you would like to make another environment, 
you may do so by using the \verb+\newtheorem+ command,
followed by the name you want to use when you use the 
command, followed by the name as you want it to print in text,
followed by \verb+[chapter]+ so this kind of theorem
environment will renumber with each new journal article:

\begin{verbatim}
\newtheorem{<name of term>}{<term as it appears in text>}[chapter]
\end{verbatim}

For instance;

\begin{verbatim}
\newtheorem{suppose}{Wild Supposition}[chapter]
\end{verbatim}

\newtheorem{suppose}{Wild Supposition}[chapter]

\newpage
Using the new environment:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{suppose}
In our most hopeful moments, we may suppose..
\end{suppose}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\begin{suppose}
In our most hopeful moments, we may suppose..
\end{suppose}
\endresults

\subsection{Unnumbered headings: Proof, Definition, and similar environments}
If you would like to use the following headings in your
article, please use the following commands:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{proof}
It is completely indisputable that we have...
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
This is our definition...
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Remarkably enough...
\end{remark}

\begin{note}

\begin{result}

\end{result}
\endresults

\subsection{Proof}
The proof environment has only one peculiarity: if
the proof ends with an equation you must end
the equation with the command \verb+\inmathqed+ to
make the qed box position correctly. The following 
example shows a proof using \verb+\inmathqed+.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{proof}
The running time of this algorithm is clearly polynomial in 
{\bf size}$(f_T)$ and the length of the longest example seen.

\[ \alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta\inmathqed \]
\end{proof}\end{verbatim}
\endcode

The running time of this algorithm is clearly polynomial in 
{\bf size}$(f_T)$ and the length of the longest example seen.

\[

\endresults

This command will work with equations and eqnarray, as seen below.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{proof}
Things to be proven...

\begin{eqnarray*}
g_i(y|f)&=&\sum_x P(x|F_n)\\
g_2(y|f)&=&\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\inmathqed

\end{eqnarray*}
\end{proof}
\endresults

\newpage
You may want to include a title with your proof. Here
is how to do that:


\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem A.1]
This is a proof with a title. The title is entered
in square brackets.
\end{proof}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\newpage
\subsection{Using Proclaim}
The
following example shows \verb+\proclaim+ used for a theorem, but
it can also be used for Corollary, Lemma, Proposition, Demonstration, etc. 
Each new theorem type environment should be numbered consecutively within
its type. For instance, if we used theorem, lemma, theorem, the numbering
should be Theorem 1, Lemma 1, Theorem 2.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{proclaim}{Theorem 1}LEARN-MONOTONE-K-CNF makes at most
$(n+1)^K$ mistakes on any monotone K-CNF formula. (Recall that
n is the size of the largest example seen.
\end{proclaim}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\begin{proclaim}{Theorem 1}LEARN-MONOTONE-K-CNF makes at most
$(n+1)^K$ mistakes on any monotone K-CNF formula. (Recall that
n is the size of the largest example seen.
\end{proclaim}
\endresults

\subsection{Assumptions and Similar Statements}
The command \verb+\begin{demo}+ can be used for Assumptions
and similar kinds of statements:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{demo}{Assumption 1}
The database variables, which we denote as $Z$, are discrete.
\end{demo}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
\begin{demo}{Assumption 1}

\newpage
\section{End of Article}
Getting the end of article commands in the right order will not
be difficult if you use the smjtmpl.tex template file.
The commands should be used in this order:
Acknowledgements (optional), Appendix (optional), Endnotes (if footnotes
were used), References.

This is how the commands appear in the smjtmpl.tex file:

\begin{verbatim}
%% End matter:

% \acknowledgments

% \appendix{}

% \notes

% \begin{references}

\subsection{Appendices}
Make your appendix with the command \verb+\appendix{}+, as seen below.
If you want only one appendix, follow \verb+\appendix+ with facing
curly brackets: \verb+\appendix{}+.
If you want to use more than one appendix, write \verb+\appendix{A}+,
\verb+\appendix{B}+, etc. 

If you want an appendix title, use the command \verb+\appendixtitle{<title>}+.

Section numbers, equation numbers, and captions will all use the 
appendix letter as well as their number.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\appendix{}

\subsection{End notes}If you have footnotes in your text you
will want to print endnotes. End notes will print automatically
if you use either the command \verb+\begin{references}+ or \hfill\break
\verb+\begin{alphareferences}+. If you haven't used either of
these commands, you may write \verb+\notes+ in your text
before your bibliography. This will cause the end notes to
print at that point in your text.

\subsection{Reference information}
Your options when making a reference section are explained in
some detail in the next section.

\subsection{Article End}
Each article must end with the command:
\verb+\end{article}+. This command is found in the
template file. Please do not delete it.

\section{References}
References may be made with or without Bib\TeX. This section will
demonstrate how to make references without Bib\TeX; the following
section will describe the steps needed to make a bibliography with
Bib\TeX.

There are two ways to make a reference section. First is the
way to make numbered references and reference citations. Second
is the method of making alphabetical references.

Here is the way to make the numbered references.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{references}
....
\end{references}
\end{verbatim}

Each reference item starts 
with the command \verb+\bibitem+ followed by a term surrounded
by curly brackets which is used for cross-referencing the 
bibliographic entry. The number of the bibliographic
entry will be printed when the term is used with \verb+\cite+:
\verb+\cite{jacobs}+, for example. (The file must be \LaTeX ed
twice for this to work. The first time the file is processed,
\verb+\cite{label}+ will produce `[?]'.)


\code
\begin{verbatim}
Here is a citation from the reference section: \cite{jacobs}.

\begin{references}
\bibitem{francis} Francis, M., ``Out-of-Band Response of Array Antennas,''
{\it Antenna Meas. Tech. Proc.}, 
September 28--October 2, 1987, Seattle, p.~14.

\bibitem{jacobs}Jacobs, E., ``Design Method Optimizes Scanning
Phased Array,'' {\it Microwaves}, April 1982, pp.\ 69--70.
\end{references}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

Phased Array,'' {\it Microwaves}, April 1982, pp.\ 69--70.

\endresults
}


\newpage
\subsection{Making an Alphabetical Reference Section}
To make an alphabetized reference section use
the commands \newline
\verb+\begin{alphareferences}...\end{alphareferences}+.
This style does not use 
\verb+bibitem+ so we cannot use \verb+\cite+. (\verb+\bibitem[]{}+
is the command that defines the label used with \verb+\cite+.)
So the author simply writes the reference in the text:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
Maude Francis, (Francis, 1987) showed important new results
with array antennas.

\begin{alphareferences}
Francis, M., ``Out-of-Band Response of Array 
Antennas,'' {\it Antenna Meas. Tech. Proc.}, September 28--October 2,
1987, Seattle, p.~14.

Jacobs, E., ``Design Method Optimizes Scanning
Phased Array,'' {\it Microwaves}, April 1982, pp.\ 69--70.
\end{alphareferences}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
Maude Francis, (Francis, 1987) showed important new results
with array antennas.

\begin{alphareferences}

Jacobs, E., ``Design Method Optimizes Scanning
Phased Array,'' {\it Microwaves}, April 1982, pp.\ 69--70.
\end{alphareferences}
\endresults

If you want to use alphabetical references but still
use \verb+\cite{}+ you can
precede each entry with

\noindent
\verb+\bibitem[<term as it will print>]{<term you write in text>}+

\newpage
When you want to cite these references in your text, you
refer to the entry using \verb+\cite{}+. For instance,

\code
\begin{verbatim}
Maude Francis, \cite{fr87} showed important new results
with array antennas.  

\begin{alphareferences}

\bibitem[Jacobs, 1982]{ja82}Jacobs, E., ``Design Method Optimizes 
Scanning Phased Array,'' {\it Microwaves}, April 1982, pp.\ 69--70.

\end{verbatim}

\section{Using Bib\TeX}
You may use Bib\TeX\ with the Kluwer small journal style.

Bib\TeX\ is a separate program which can be used with \LaTeX\ to
produce a database file and build a bibliography. Its use is described
in the \LaTeX\ book, p.~74--75, and p.~140--147.  
If you have never used Bib\TeX\ before,
you might consider doing so. The major advantages to using Bib\TeX\ are
that you can build a database of your references
that you can reuse for other books or articles, and
you can choose from a number of bibliographic styles.

To use Bib\TeX\ follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Make a xxx.bib file, with `xxx' being any file name you choose. 
This is the database file
including all the references. The form that these entries should take
is described in the \LaTeX\ book.

\item
In your .tex file you must enter \verb+\bibliographystyle{(style)}+.
Your choices
of bibliography style are:\hfill\break
{\tt plain, unsrt, alpha, abbrv}. \hfill\break
The styles
are described on p.~74 of the \LaTeX\ book. For Kluwer small journal
style you must enter \verb+\bibliographystyle{plain}+. 

Next you must write \verb+\bibliography{xxx}+, with `xxx' being the name of 
the .bib database file that you have written. You can also use more
than one .bib file, in which case you must separate the filenames with
a comma: \verb+\bibliography{xxx,yyy}+.

\item
Run Latex on the .tex document, producing the usual .aux file. When you
look at the .aux file you will see that it now contains
\verb+\bibstyle{(style)}+ and \verb+\bibdata{xxx}+.

\item
Run Bib\TeX\ on the .tex document, producing  a .bbl file, 

\item
And, finally, run \LaTeX\ on the .tex file, and Voila! there is your
bibliography, neatly done in the style you have chosen. The citations
in the text will also take the form you have chosen when you named
the bibliography style.
\end{enumerate}


\newpage
Here is an example:

First we make a file called sample.bib which contains these entries:

\begin{verbatim}
@BOOK	(samp:key,
	AUTHOR = "Strunk, Jr., William and E. B. White",
	TITLE= "The Elements of Style",
	PUBLISHER = "Macmillan",
	EDITION = "Third",
	YEAR = 1979,
	ADDRESS = "New York")

@BOOK	(second:thing,
	AUTHOR = "Calvin Coolidge",
	TITLE= "The Cats of Maine",
	PUBLISHER = "Silly Press",
	YEAR = 1914,
	ADDRESS = "Chatham, Maine, USA")
\end{verbatim}

Then, in our .tex file we enter citations and the two
bibliography commands:


\begin{verbatim}
Here are citations, \cite{samp:key}, \cite{second:thing}.

\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{sample}
\end{verbatim}

Next, we run \LaTeX\ on the .tex file. When we look at the .aux
file we have just produced, we see that it now contains these entries:

\begin{verbatim}
\bibstyle{plain}
\bibdata{sample}
...
\end{verbatim}

Then  we run Bib\TeX\ on the same .tex file to
produce the .bbl file. You can look at, and edit the .bbl file
if you'd like. Finally, we re-LaTeX our .tex file and produce these results:
\vskip6pt
\hrule
\vskip6pt
{ \linewidth=30pc
\let\section\savesection
Here are citations, [2], [1].

\begin{thebibliography}{1}
\bibitem{second:thing}
Calvin Coolidge.
\newblock {\it The Cats of Maine}.
\newblock Silly Press, Chatham, Maine, USA, 1914.

\bibitem{samp:key}
William Strunk, Jr. and E.~B. White.
\newblock {\it The Elements of Style}.
\newblock Macmillan,
New York, third edition, 1979.
\end{thebibliography}
\vskip6pt
\hrule
\vskip6pt
}

\newpage

\subsection{Alphabetical Bibliography}
If you would prefer to have an alphabetic bibliography, instead
of the numbered one as shown on the previous page, you can follow
all the previous steps, with the exception of using the command
\verb+\alphabibliography+ instead of \verb+\bibliography+.

\begin{verbatim}
Here are citations, \cite{second:thing}, \cite{samp:key}.

\bibliographystyle{plain}
\alphabibliography{sample}
\end{verbatim}

This will produce a bibliography that looks like this:
\vskip6pt
\hrule
\vskip6pt
{ \linewidth=30pc
\hsize=30pc

\let\section\savesection
\let\thebibliography\bibalpharefs
\let\endthebibliography\endbibalpharefs

\begin{thebibliography}{1}
\bibitem{second:thing}
Calvin Coolidge.
\newblock {\it The Cats of Maine}.
\newblock Silly Press, Chatham, Maine, USA, 1914.
\bibitem{samp:key}
William Strunk, Jr. and E.~B. White.
\newblock {\it The Elements of Style}.
\newblock Macmillan,
New York, third edition, 1979.
\end{thebibliography}
\vskip6pt
\hrule
\vskip6pt
}


\vskip18pt
\noindent{\it Citations when using Alphabibliography}

For making citations in the text of your article when you
have used \verb+alphabibliography+, you have two choices,
either enter the name and year of your reference in your
text, or edit the .bbl file to add label information. 

Here is an example of simply writing the appropriate label
in the text:
\code
\begin{verbatim}
and, when discussing Maine coon cats, we can't overlook
the important treatise by Calvin Coolidge, (Coolidge, 1914)...
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\results
and, when discussing Maine Coon cats, we can't overlook
the important treatise by Calvin Coolidge, (Coolidge, 1914)...
\endresults

\vskip-18pt
If you have some reason to want to use \verb+\cite+ you will
have to edit the .bbl file. Following \verb+\bibitem+ you
must add the name of the author and year in square brackets 
as you would like the
reference to appear in the text. The term in curly brackets it
what you will use following \verb+\cite+.

\noindent
\verb+\bibitem[<term as it will print>]{<term you write in text>}+

\newpage
The .bbl file before it is edited:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{thebibliography}{1}

\bibitem{second:thing}
Calvin Coolidge.
\newblock {\it The Cats of Maine}.
\newblock Silly Press, Chatham, Maine, USA, 1914.

\bibitem{samp:key}
William Strunk, Jr. and E.~B. White.
\newblock {\it The Elements of Style}.
\newblock Macmillan, New York, third edition, 1979.

\end{thebibliography}
\end{verbatim}

The .bbl file after being given labels:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{thebibliography}{1}

\bibitem[Coolidge, 1914]{second:thing}
Calvin Coolidge.
\newblock {\it The Cats of Maine}.
\newblock Silly Press, Chatham, Maine, USA, 1914.

\bibitem[Strunk and White, 1979]{samp:key}
William Strunk, Jr. and E.~B. White.
\newblock {\it The Elements of Style}.
\newblock Macmillan, New York, third edition, 1979.

\end{thebibliography}
\end{verbatim}

Now you can use \verb+\cite+:
\code
\begin{verbatim}
and, when discussing Maine coon cats, we can't overlook
the important treatise by Calvin Coolidge, \cite{second:thing}...
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\results
and, when discussing Maine Coon cats, we can't overlook
the important treatise by Calvin Coolidge, (Coolidge, 1914)...

\section{Sample Pages}
The following pages show a typeset sample article
with the \LaTeX\ code that produced each page.


The issue and volume table of contents have not been
discussed in this documentation previously, yet are
shown here. Authors do not need to use these commands,
but they are shown here 
as a sample for the people doing production of
the complete journal. 

Production people: note that you can break lines in the
issue table of contents or the volume table of contents
with the \verb+\\+ command.

If you find that you are having a problem {\bf after you have read
this documentation carefully}, and if you are sure that you
have the current version of the style file and documenation,
help may be had by sending email
to Suzanne Rumsey at {\tt prod@world.std.com}. If possible, please send a
small file demonstrating the problem you are having.

\section{Introduction}
We have been engaged in a project to understand human categorization which
has let us to develop a machine learning algorithm. Our research began as an
exploration of the issue of whether human categorization can be considered
optimal.

To pursue the issue of whether human cognition is optimal requires
specifying two things. First we need a definition of optimality.
second, we need a specification of the structure of the environment
so we can determine what behavior is optimal in that environment.

\subsection{Preliminary definition of optimization}
Our assumption has been that the goal of categorization is to predict
unknown features of various objects that we encounter.

\subsubsection{The structure of the environment}
Our theory of the structure of the environment has been focused the
structure of living things (arguably, the largest portion of the
objects in the world) because of the aid biology gives in objectively
specifying the organization of these objects.

\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)

where $g_i(y|F_n)$ is the function specifying the probability an
object will display a value $y$ on a dimension $i$ given $F_n$ the
observed feature structure of all the objects.

Here is an example of a wide equation:

\subsection{To Illustrate an Algorithm}

This is the command to use when you want to illustrate an algorithm
with some pseudo code. A backslash followed with a space will
indent the line. Every line will be printed
as it is seen on the screen. Blank lines will be preserved.
Math and font changes may be used. 

The command
\verb+\bit+ will produce bold italics if you are using PostScript fonts, 
boldface in Computer Modern. \verb+\note{}+ will position the
note on the right margin. A backslash followed by a space
will provide a space a bit wider than the width of 2 `M's.

\begin{algorithm}
{\bit Evaluate-Single-FOE} ({\bf x$_f$, I$_0$, I$_1$}):
\ {\bf I}+ := {\bf I}$_1$;
\ ($\phi,\theta$) := (0,0);
\ {\it repeat}\note{/*usually only 1 interation required*/}
\ \ (s$_{opt}${\bf E}$_\eta$) := {\bit Optimal-Shift} %
    ({\bf I$_0$,I$^+$,I$_0$,x$_f$});
\ \ ($\phi^+$, $\theta^+$) := {\bit Equivalent-Rotation} ({\bf s}$_{opt}$);
\ \ ($\phi$, $\theta$) := ($\phi$, $\theta$) + ($\phi^+$, $\theta^+$);
\ \ {\bf I}$^+$:= {\bit Derotate-Image} ({\bf I}$_1$, $\phi$, $\theta$);
\ \ {\it until} ($|\phi^+|\leq\phi_{max}$ \& $|\theta^+|\leq\theta_{max}$);
\ {\it return} ({\bf I}$^+$, $\phi$, $\theta$, E$_\eta$).
End pseudo-code.

\subsection{Figures}
Here is an example of a figure with .5 inch space left for
the illustration:
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace*{.5in}
\caption{This is a figure caption.
This is a figure caption.
This is a figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\section{Making Tables}
Use caption on top of the table. 
Use \verb+\hline+ at the top of the table, underneath the column headers
and at the end of the table.

You are discouraged from using vertical lines in tables, but
it you must include vertical lines, you must also use 
\verb+\savehline+ instead of \verb+\hline+ or there will be a
gap between the vertical and horizontal lines.
(\verb+\hline+ has been redefined to add some vertical space above and
below it.)

The following form will spread out to the width of the page:

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{This is an example table caption. As you can
see, it will be as wide as the table that it captions.}
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lcr}
\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr
\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr
\hline
\end{tabular*}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{This is a table caption and will fit
the width of the table that it is captioning.}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr

\begin{example}
Consider an example in which $B_S$ is the structure...

The term $P(B_X)$ is our probability---prior to observing the data in
database $D$---that the data-generating process is a belief network
with structure $B_{S1}$.
\end{example}

\begin{proclaim}{Theorem 1}LEARN-MONOTONE-K-CNF makes at most
$(n+1)^K$ mistakes on any monotone K-CNF formula. (Recall that n is
the size of the largest example seen.  
\end{proclaim}

\begin{proof}
Thus on each mistake, we decrease the cost by at least 1, and since the 
cost is never negative, the algorithm makes less than $(n+1)^K$
mistakes total.

The running time of this algorithm is clearly polynomial in 
{\bf size}$(f_T)$ and the length of the longest example seen.
\end{proof}

{\bf size}$(f_T)$ and the length of the longest example seen.

\[

\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem A.1]
This is a proof with a particular term. Call for the particular term
after `proof', i.e., \verb+\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem A.1]+.
\end{proof}

In this section, we present an efficient formula for computing $P(B_X, D)$.
We do so by first introducing four assumptions.

\begin{demo}{Assumption 1}
The database variables, which we denote as $Z$, are discrete.
\end{demo}

As this assumption states...
