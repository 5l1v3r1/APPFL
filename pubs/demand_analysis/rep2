Kei,

Attached below are some comments on your PEPM paper.

Regards,

Clem

`PERs from projections for binding-time analysis' -- Kei Davis.


My initial reaction was that the paper assumes quite a deep background
knowledge of projection-based analyses and that little consideration is
given to the more general reader.  On reflection, constraints on length
and common sense suggest that rewriting to suit a larger target audience
is unreasonable.  Nevertheless, I think more space could be devoted to
the PER correspondence and its import.


Some more particular comments and queries (If they demonstrate my lack
of understanding, perhaps you should take them as possibly indicating
a need for clarification):

section 2.2.
I don't understand why products are unlifted.  It apparently happens by
subterfuge through taking separated sums -- in most cases at least.

Section 4.
This is pretty tough going, especially with the definition of R[[T]]
left hanging for almost a page before we see the point.  All that kept
me going was that it looked like a PER so I had some intuitions to fall
back on.  Perhaps a hint of where you are heading at the start of this
section.

section 5.
I don't see the comparison with BHA strictness analysis.  Isn't the
double lifting tied up with the different kind (or amount) of
information that is represented?  (I admit that I don't know much about
the reversal relation between strictness and binding time analysis, so
maybe that's my problem.)

One of your rules defining fabsf refers to projection transformers (I
presume?).  That is: \tau_1 \in FTran_T_1.

Section 6.
Thank goodness for these well-chosen and well-explained examples!
