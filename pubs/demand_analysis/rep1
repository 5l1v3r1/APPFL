Kei,

Thank you for your comments.

On your paper, I've been trying unsuccessfully to read it , since I
know very little about projections and nothing about PERs.  Hence,
there is little I can say that is constructive.  I will say, however,
that it is terse and hard to read.  I found the derivation of results
concluded rather obscurely, particularly the realtionship between your
work and the PER technique (this is result that the relation R is a
PER?)  In the introduction, you don't mention that the abstract
domains you build compare favourably with those from BHA strictness
analysis, which is certainly one of the results of the paper.

There is a typo in Figure 2: function application appears twice.

On the definition of R, the first clause for integers appears to be
parameterised by a three-tuple, but this doesn't appear in the
subsequent clauses - perhaps this is deliberate?

But generally, very hard to read.  Unfortunately, you don't have much
space for the journal version, otherwise I would recommend a review
section at the beginning to introduce projections for b/time analysis
in greater depth.

Simon
