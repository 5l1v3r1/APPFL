To setup the tasty test framework:

cabal install tasty tasty-golden tasty-quickcheck tasty-hunit tasty-ant-xml
cabal configure --enable-tests

then run:
cabal test

to clean and rerun:
cabal test

Appendix:

I now have a taste of what cabal-hell is about... This worked fine on 2 machines
but then I got into a mess on the 3rd. After cabal clean I would have to 
reconfigure. Using the ghc packages on ubuntu is a mistake, use the generic 
linux binaries from haskell.org

Cleanup:
apt-get remove haskell-platform
rm -rf ~/.cabal
rm -rf ~/.ghc
cd / 
tar xf haskell-platform-2014.2.0.0-unknown-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
/usr/local/haskell/ghc-7.8.3-x86_64/bin/activate-hs 
cabal update
cabal install tasty 
cabal install tasty-golden tasty-quickcheck 
cabal install tasty-hunit tasty-ant-xml
