ABSTRACT

APPFL is a pure functional programming language compiler and runtime system.
More specifically, the language syntax is a subset of Haskell but the
semantics support varying degrees of strictness necessary for automatic
parallelization.

This code is unclassified and has been assigned LA-CC-15-073. Los Alamos
National Laboratoryâ€™s Export Control Team made an in-house determination that
this software is controlled under Department of Commerce regulations and the
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) EAR99. The export control review
is attached.

This code was developed using funding from the LANL Laboratory-Directed
Research Development (LDRD) Program.  Larry Kwei, LAFO Program Manager, has
granted his concurrence to asserting copyright and then distributing the
APPFL, Version 0.x code using an open source software license. See attached
memo.
