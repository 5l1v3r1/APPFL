Code Generation Rules

1. Expressions

let { x = obj ... } in e

Build obj's on heap
(Recursively) generate code for e

2. Heap objects

2.1 FUN

2.2 PAP

2.3 CON(C a1 ... an)

2.4 THUNK e

When a thunk is called it returns its resulting value.

CALL(CmmFnVal f, PtrOrLiteral pho)  -- f is cmm function for thunk, pho is the thunk object
                                    -- the thunk object contains its free variables
