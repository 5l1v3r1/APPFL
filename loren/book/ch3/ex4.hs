{-
Two functions may be the same, but they could be expressed quite differently 
syntactically. It would be necessary to check all inputs in the domain to see
if the functions have corresponding equal outputs. If the domain is infinite,
it is impossible to check all inputs and equivalently check if the functions 
are equal.
